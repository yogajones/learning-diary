# Lifelong Learning Diary

The Lifelong Learning Diary web application is a versatile and user-centric tool designed to support the continuous learning journey of both university students and lifelong learners. Instead of viewing learning as a series of projects, our application recognizes it as a lifelong endeavor, providing users with a single, personal, and private learning diary entity.

## Key Features

- **Unified Learning Diary:** Embrace lifelong learning with a single, comprehensive learning diary for all your educational experiences, whether you're a university student or a lifelong learner exploring diverse fields.
- **Course and Project Integration:** Attach specific courses, workshops, or other learning journeys (e.g., "Web Applications 101" at university or "Cyber Security Nordic 2023" in your professional life) to your journal entries for contextual reference.
- **Custom Tagging:** Personalize your entries with custom tags to categorize and organize your learning journey effectively.
- **Privacy by Default:** Your journal entries are automatically set to private, ensuring the utmost confidentiality of your personal and learning-related reflections.
- **User Accounts:** Access to the learning diary requires user registration, guaranteeing a secure and personalized experience.
- **User-Specific Dashboard:** Get a quick overview of your latest entries and insights with a user-specific dashboard that keeps you up-to-date.
- **Breakthrough Moments:** Mark significant insights with the "Breakthrough" tag, signifying pivotal moments in your learning journey.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automatic Hashtags:** Coming soon, automatic hashtag generation will help you easily categorize and explore your journal entries by topics and themes.
- **Learning Groups:** Form learning groups and share entries exclusively within your group members, fostering collaborative learning experiences while maintaining privacy.
- **Public Entries:** Choose to make select journal entries public, allowing you to share your insights with a broader community of learners and experts.
